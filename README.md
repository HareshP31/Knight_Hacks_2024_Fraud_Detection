# Project: Risk Radar

## Project Description

The increasing number of fraudulent transactions in today's financial landscape motivated us to create a solution that would empower individuals and businesses to quickly identify and act on suspicious activities. Our aim was to create an accessible and efficient tool to help improve financial security and reduce fraud risks.

## Functionality

Uses machine learning to analyze transaction data and determine the likelihood of fraud
- Identifies potential fraudulent activities based on patterns within the data
- Provides a risk score for each transaction
- High-risk transactions are flagged for further review

## Features

- List the key features of the project
- Bullet points work well for this section
- Mention unique functionality or aspects of the project

## Technologies

- The project is built using Python and popular data science libraries.
- Utilizes pandas and numpy for data generation and processing.
- scikit-learn is used to train and evaluate a Random Forest model.
- The model predicts the probability of fraud for each transaction.
- The final model is deployed in a streamlined application using
- Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Streacth Goals

We aim to further refine and nuance our data models by expanding the identifiers and features that contribute to fraud detection. By incorporating additional data points—such as user behavior patterns and location-based analytics—we plan to create a more comprehensive set of features for our machine learning model.
